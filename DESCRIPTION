Title: Batch Effect Correction with Unknow Subtypes for scRNA-seq data
Version: 0.99.0
Date: 2021-05-04
Description: The Batch effect correction with Unknow Subtypes for scRNA-seq Data (BUSseq) is an interpretable Bayesian hierarchical model that closely follows the data-generating mechanism of scRNA-seq experiments. BUSseq can simultaneously correct batch effects, cluster cell types, impute missing data caused by dropout events, and detect differentially expressed genes without requiring a preliminary normalization step.
